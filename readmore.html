             <p>The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall.<be/>
            The problem was originally posed in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975 (Selvin 1975a), (Selvin 1975b).</br>
            It became famous as a question from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990 (vos Savant 1990a): </p>
             <h3>Let's Make a Deal!</h3>

<p>Imagine that the set of Monty Hall's game show Let's Make a Deal has three closed doors. Behind one of these doors is a car; behind the other two are goats.<br/>
The contestant does not know where the car is, but Monty Hall does.The contestant picks a door and Monty opens one of the remaining doors, one he knows doesn't hide the car.<br/>
If the contestant has already chosen the correct door, Monty is equally likely to open either of the two remaining doors.

After Monty has shown a goat behind the door that he opens, the contestant is always given the option to switch doors.<br/>
<b>What is the probability of winning the car if she stays with her first choice? What if she decides to switch?</b></p>
